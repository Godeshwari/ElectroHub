# 🚀 ElectroHub — Modern E-Commerce Website

Welcome to ElectroHub — a sleek, fully responsive e-commerce website built with core web technologies. This project showcases a complete online shopping experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ElectroHub brings the digital storefront to life with interactive pages, dynamic elements, and clean UI design — all crafted to mimic real-world online shopping behavior. ElectroHub demonstrates practical front-end development skills and a strong foundation in building user-centric web applications.

This project does not (yet) include backend or database logic — it focuses on front-end UI/UX and client-side behavior.
